#Design Choices

- As done in the original site, no such bigger additional desgin choices from my side.

- Tried to stick to the original Theme & personality of the entire original Homepage(like background-color, color, fonts-styles, layouts, etc). Tried to keep it consistent throughout.

- Tried to keep the overall design of each sections as simplistic as possible as is in the original website Homepage.

#Challenges

- Dealing with visual scrolling animations applied on each sections for smaller screen sizes.

- Dealing with overflowing contents on the y-direction on smaller screen sizes.

- Making sections responsive to small mobile screen sizes(not a challenge like that, but still had to think a bit).

#Additional Features

- Added a decent looking & designed popping Sidebar that pops from the right when Hamburger menu icon clicked situated at the top-right corner of the Navbar(appears on smaller screen sizes). Added appealing hover styles on the fonts of the menus appearing in this Sidebar.

- Added a slightly different Hero-section animation emphasizing more on the "Apply Now" button when the Homepage first loads to draw the targetted audience's(internship oriented students) attention and engagement.

- Added scrolling animations on different sections on every scroll & not just at the beginning scroll when the page first loads so that the targetted end-user remains engaged throughout scrolling the Homepage.

- Added different slightly visually appealing testimonials(glass like moving effect upon hover on a testimonial) to make the targetted end-users shift their focus on actually reading the testimonials, instead of using the Carousel swipe infinite interval animation on the testimonials like the original site which would make our targetted audience shy away from actually engaging in this section.

- Added slightly visually appealing Footer links upon hovering over them.

- Removed the minute "About Us" part of the Features section on smaller screen sizes, since it's not depicting the Features section & takes up uneccessary space for a smaller sized viewport, so tried to keep it crisp.

#Enjoy ;)
